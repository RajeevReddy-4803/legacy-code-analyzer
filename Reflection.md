## Reflection

This exercise helped me understand how real enterprise
systems encode business rules directly in code.

Challenges:
- Understanding unfamiliar domain logic
- Identifying which code paths are critical

Learnings:
- Legacy code is valuable, not bad
- Modernization should start with understanding, not rewriting

With more time:
- I would extract call relationships
- I would classify validation rules in detail
